the following command fails:
    ./neatdict -m 300k test/x

it seems that it happens because bound_chunk is called more than once for
each chunk, and a chunk which already contains DISABLED_LINE flags may
be harder to bound.

A solution consists in changing chunk->addr/chunk->size to
chunk->start/chunk->end (size_t objs) which acts as boundaries.
